They are described as zealots who do not assess the utilities or benefits of the norm and are unwavering in their support.\n2. **Elites**: Influential individuals in society, such as celebrities and politicians, who have large networks and can advertise norms based on the logic of consequences. They assess the utilities and benefits of norm adoption relative to their social power.\n3. **Less Powerful/New Elites**: These are potential targets for norm promoters because they may see new norms as tools to maximize their utility and balance power against more powerful, old elites.\n4. **International Organizations and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs)**: These entities may be used by advocates to convince elites to adopt norms.\n5. **General Public**: The wider audience that is reached through the influence of elites and the cascading process of norm adoption.\n\n### Factors:\n1. **Social Positioning of Advocates**: Advocates may not be in a position to effectively promote norms on their own and thus rely on elites.\n2. **Logic of Appropriateness vs. Logic of Consequences**: Advocates promote norms based on what is deemed appropriate, while elites consider the consequences and benefits of adopting norms.\n3. **Balance of Power**: The tipping point in the norm life cycle is reached when the balance of power between opponents and proponents of the new norm shifts.\n4. **Humanitarian Norms**: These norms have a unique cascading process due to the degradation of humanitarian values and associated punishments.\n5. **Social Punishment and Peer Pressure**: These mechanisms can influence individuals to adopt norms by making the social benefits of adoption outweigh the costs.\n\n### Mechanisms:\n1. **Convincing Elites**: Advocates increase their reach by convincing influential elites to adopt and promote norms.\n2. **Norm Life Cycle**: The process through which a norm becomes dominant, involving stages such as the tipping point and norm cascading.\n3. **Norm Cascading**: The rapid spread of a norm after it reaches the tipping point, leading to widespread adoption across different societal groups.\n4. **Socialization by Elites**: During the cascade phase, elites must socialize the norm to persuade others to adopt it.\n5. **Assessment of Costs and Benefits**: Individuals adopt new norms based on the logic of consequences, weighing the costs and benefits of adoption.\n6. **Punishment Mechanisms**: Norms associated with punishments can prevent individuals from losing interest and delay the cascade process.\n\nThese actors, factors, and mechanisms collectively describe the complex process of how norms are promoted, adopted, and become dominant within a society."
