gpt-4o,"In the provided text, the actors, factors, and mechanisms involved in the process of norm promotion and adoption are as follows:

### Actors:
1. **Advocates**: Individuals or groups who promote norms based on a logic of appropriateness. They are described as zealots who do not assess the utilities or benefits of the norm and are unwavering in their support.
2. **Elites**: Influential individuals in society, such as celebrities and politicians, who have large networks and can advertise norms based on the logic of consequences. They assess the utilities and benefits of norm adoption relative to their social power.
3. **Less Powerful/New Elites**: These are potential targets for norm promoters because they may see new norms as tools to maximize their utility and balance power against more powerful, old elites.
4. **International Organizations and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs)**: These entities may be used by advocates to convince elites to adopt norms.
5. **General Public**: The wider audience that is reached through the influence of elites and the cascading process of norm adoption.

### Factors:
1. **Social Positioning of Advocates**: Advocates may not be in a position to effectively promote norms on their own and thus rely on elites.
2. **Logic of Appropriateness vs. Logic of Consequences**: Advocates promote norms based on what is deemed appropriate, while elites consider the consequences and benefits of adopting norms.
3. **Balance of Power**: The tipping point in the norm life cycle is reached when the balance of power between opponents and proponents of the new norm shifts.
4. **Humanitarian Norms**: These norms have a unique cascading process due to the degradation of humanitarian values and associated punishments.
5. **Social Punishment and Peer Pressure**: These mechanisms can influence individuals to adopt norms by making the social benefits of adoption outweigh the costs.

### Mechanisms:
1. **Convincing Elites**: Advocates increase their reach by convincing influential elites to adopt and promote norms.
2. **Norm Life Cycle**: The process through which a norm becomes dominant, involving stages such as the tipping point and norm cascading.
3. **Norm Cascading**: The rapid spread of a norm after it reaches the tipping point, leading to widespread adoption across different societal groups.
4. **Socialization by Elites**: During the cascade phase, elites must socialize the norm to persuade others to adopt it.
5. **Assessment of Costs and Benefits**: Individuals adopt new norms based on the logic of consequences, weighing the costs and benefits of adoption.
6. **Punishment Mechanisms**: Norms associated with punishments can prevent individuals from losing interest and delay the cascade process.

These actors, factors, and mechanisms collectively describe the complex process of how norms are promoted, adopted, and become dominant within a society."
llama3,"Here are the actors, factors, and mechanisms mentioned in the text:

**Actors:**

1. Advocates
2. Elites (e.g., celebrities, politicians)
3. International organizations
4. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
5. Social media users
6. Opponents of a new norm
7. Proponents of a new norm

**Factors:**

1. Logic of appropriateness (advocates promote norms based on this logic)
2. Logic of consequences (elites advertise norms based on this logic)
3. Social power
4. Utility and benefits of norm adoption
5. Norm life cycle (including the tipping point)
6. Percent of advocates supporting a new norm
7. Degradation of humanitarian values

**Mechanisms:**

1. Convincing elites to adopt norms
2. Using international organizations or NGOs to convince elites
3. Utilizing social media to promote norms
4. Socialization of norms by elites (persuading others to adopt)
5. Peer pressure as a form of social punishment
6. Norm cascading (the rapid spread of a new norm after the tipping point)

These actors, factors, and mechanisms are relevant to understanding how norms are promoted, adopted, and spread in a society."
mistral," Actors:
1. Advocates (individuals or groups who promote a norm)
2. Elites (celebrities, politicians, less powerful new elites, etc.)
3. International organizations
4. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
5. Population at large (who may adopt the norm after the tipping point is reached)
6. Old elites (more powerful individuals or groups who initially oppose the new norm)

Factors:
1. Logic of appropriateness (advocates' motivation for promoting a norm)
2. Logic of consequences (elites' assessment of utilities and benefits of norm adoption)
3. Social power (the influence and position of elites in society)
4. Utility (the potential benefits that less powerful, new elites may see in adopting a new norm to maximize their power)
5. Costs and benefits of norm adoption (individuals' motivation to adopt a new norm based on these factors)
6. Peer pressure (a form of social punishment that can facilitate the socialization of a norm)
7. Punishment mechanisms (associated with certain norms, which can prevent individuals from losing interest in a norm over time and delaying the cascade process)

Mechanisms:
1. Convincing elites to adopt norms (through various means such as advocacy, international organizations, NGOs, or social media)
2. Socialization of a norm (elites' efforts to persuade others to adopt the norm)
3. Norm cascading (the spread of the norm throughout society after the tipping point is reached)
4. Tipping point in the norm life cycle (the shift in balance of power between proponents and opponents of the new norm, signaling that the new norm has become dominant)
5. Degradation of humanitarian values (a limiting factor in the cascading process for humanitarian norms)"
